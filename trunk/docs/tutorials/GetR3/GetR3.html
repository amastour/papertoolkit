<p class="Heading"> Get R3 and Compile it </p>
<ol>
  <li>Install an SVN client, such as <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads">TortoiseSVN</a>. For most machines, grab the 32-Bit MSI installer file.</li>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/papertoolkit/">http://code.google.com/p/papertoolkit/</a>. That is where the R3 open-source project is hosted.</li>
  <li>Create a directory for R3. For convenience, I tend to put all my projects in subdirectories of my Eclipse Workspace. You can set the workspace path under <span class="Code">File &gt; Switch Workspace...</span><br>
    <br>

    <br>
  With the above Workspace path, I would create a new directory at <span class="Code">C:\Documents and Settings\Ron Yeh\My Documents\Projects\PaperToolkit</span>. Some of my colleagues like shorter paths, and will use something like <span class="Code">C:\Dev\PaperToolkit</span>. It's your call. </li>
  <li>In the google hosting page, you can find the SVN URL for downloading R3. For anonymous access, use <span class="Code"><strong><em>http</em></strong>://papertoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/</span>. <br>
    <br>
  <img src="GoogleCode.png" alt="Google Code" width="775" height="380"><br>
  <br>
  You will need to enter this URL into TortoiseSVN's checkout panel. Alternatively, if you have command-line subversion, you can just type in the command as displayed on the google web page. </li>
  <li>Right Click the empty R3 folder, and choose SVN Checkout. Type in the URL of the repository. The other settings should be left at their defaults. <br>
    <br>
  <img src="Checkout0.png" alt="Checkout" width="456" height="320"> <img src="Checkout1.png" alt="Checkout Progress" width="554" height="302"></li>
  <li>Once the Checkout is done, you will need to import the project into Eclipse. There are multiple ways to do this. I tend to use the New Java Project command.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="NewJavaProject.png" alt="NewProject" width="500" height="576"> <img src="PackageExp.png" alt="Package Explorer" width="420" height="535"><br>
    <br>
  For the Project Name, you should use the name of the folder that contains R3 (<em>e.g.</em>, PaperToolkit). Once you type the name, Eclipse will recognize that this folder already exists. You can just click Finish and Eclipse will import the project. </li>
  <li>If you are developing a project that will take advantage of R3, you will want to create your own Eclipse project that <em>references </em>R3. That way, you can leverage any of the services that the toolkit provides. Use the New Java Project command again. This time, type the name of your project. I like to choose the option &quot;Create separate source and output folders.&quot; Click Next.<br>
    <br>
      <img src="NewMyProj.png" alt="My Project" width="500" height="601"> <img src="RefR3.png" alt="Reference R3" width="500" height="455"><br>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the Projects tab, and Click Add...  Select R3 and Click OK. Click Finish. </li>
  <li>Now, you should see both your project and R3 in the same Package Explorer. You can now proceed to use R3's API in your own project.</li>
  <li>From here on out, feel free to explore R3 and use it as you see fit. If you have a question about functionality, post it to the User's Newsgroup (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/papertoolkit">http://groups.google.com/group/papertoolkit</a>). I will field questions there, and hopefully other users can chime in if they know the answer to something. R3 itself is an experiment, so I will guarantee  that it is NOT bug-free software. If you are interested, you can also join the open-source project. =)</li>
