  <li><span class="Warning">Warning:</span> If your system ever freezes up on you while clicking on a PDF that has been layered with pattern (even if you are just navigating around in Windows Explorer), it's Adobe's preloader getting confused. Hit CTRL-ALT-DEL to bring up the task manager, and kill the AcrobatInfo.exe process.<br>

  As you can see, it's taking up 50% of my CPU time, which means one of my 3.2GHz processors. Boo Acrobat.</li>
  <li><span class="Warning">Warning:</span> If Acrobat Professional loads large pattern PDFs really slowly (i.e., if you are trying to make a GIGAprint with R3), try out Acrobat Reader. It's stripped down, and loads complicated PDFs much more quickly than Acrobat Professional (at least on my machine). </li>
