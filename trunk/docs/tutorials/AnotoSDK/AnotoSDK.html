<p class="Heading">Anoto SDK  </p>
<p>Let's learn a little about the Anoto SDK.  </p>
<ol>
  <li>If you haven't, you will need to acquire the Anoto SDK from <a href="http://partner.anoto.com/cldoc/aop15.htm">Anoto AB</a>. If you are a Partner and purchase the ADK Support and Maintenance, you will be able to download the SDK.</li>
  <li>Once you have installed the SDK, you can go to <span class="Code">C:\Program Files\Anoto\Anoto SDK For PC Applications\Documentation </span>to read up on how to use it. The documentation describes how Anoto Pattern works, and how to build a .NET application that interacts with the SDK. </li>
  <li>In particular, the Samples directory provides nice examples if you want to build a C++ or a C# application. </li>
  <p>If you plan to develop  your software directly on top of the Anoto SDK, you are done. =) However, if you plan to develop your software on top of the R3 toolkit, ButterflyNet, or GIGAprints, please read on....</p>
  <li>Our paper tools interact with the Anoto SDK. They provide a higher level &quot;wrapper&quot; so that the designer or developer who uses our tools does not need to worry about creating and registering COM objects. Also, if you like Java, then you have come to the right place. Our tools are built with <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">Java</a> using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse IDE</a>. We also provide hooks into design environments like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/">Adobe (Macromedia) Flash</a>.</li>
  <li>This is my quick sketch of how the systems interact with each other.<br>
    The sketch is actually misleading (at the moment) because R3 is a much newer and smaller project than GIGAprints or BNet. However, as R3 grows and incorporates the best features from GIGAprints and BNet, the role that R3 plays will become larger over time. Ideally, a designer or developer will not need to build on top of GIGAprints or BNet. <br>
