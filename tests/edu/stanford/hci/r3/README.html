<p class="Heading">The R3 Tests</p>
<p>TODO: This folder should be moved into a new tests branch of the SVN repository. Thus, someone who imports the R3 toolkit will not see all the random *Test.java classes.</p>
<p>However, the tradeoff would be that when refactoring code in the main branch, the tests break. =\ A possible solution to this would be that users of the toolkit can remove the tests/ folder from the source path in Eclipse. Then, eclipse will not consider those classes for autocomplete. I can also do this for notable releases (i.e., zipped up releases).</p>
