/**
 * <p>
 * Represents the Application that we are creating, including its Sheets, Regions, and Event Handlers. This
 * "Document" also contains metadata about the application, and can later help us generate Java code to run
 * the application.
 * 
 * It is unclear whether we actually need this class yet... as ideally, everything can just be stored in the
 * Application object. But, we'll see...
 * 
 * Perhaps this class serves just as the Model for the Designer GUI.
 * 
 * In that case... we should think about it as we push toward the DiamondTouch + Paper design environment.
 * This GUI should support Full Screen mode (or maybe it would be a separate GUI). But nonetheless, keep this
 * in mind.
