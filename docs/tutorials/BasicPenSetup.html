<p class="Heading">Basic Pen Setup </p>
<p>Nokia SU-1B </p>
<ol>
  <li>If you bought an SU-1B, you should have a CD that Nokia provided. Pop in the CD, and follow the instructions.</li>
  <li>Once you have installed &amp; rebooted, you should be able to write on a commercial Anoto notebook (e.g., Esselte A5, Mead 5x8 Cambridge Limited) and drop your pen into the cradle. You will see a dialog with an upload progress bar. Once it is done, you can open your digital notes using the Nokia-provided browser, and do fun stuff like animate your handwriting. </li>
  <li>The default software allows you to copy ink strokes to external applications, such as MS Word.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Logitech IO2 (with or without Bluetooth)</p>
<ol>
  <li>The installation procedure is very similar to the Nokia procedure.</li>
  <li>&lt;more to come...&gt;</li>
