/**
 * <p>
 * This app demonstrates two features of the toolkit: 1) the batched data upload & event handlers, and 2)
 * creating sheets and regions on the fly, saving them out to disk, and reloading them for future use.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The idea is that in Design Mode, a person can draw out a number of checkboxes or inking regions, which will
 * be saved to disk. Check boxes are small squares/rectangles, whereas inking regions are large rectangles.
