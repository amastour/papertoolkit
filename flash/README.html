This folder contains resources for interacting with Adobe Flash.<br/>
Designers can use the resources here to connect paper applications with their Flash interfaces.<br/>
For best results, install the Flash Debug Player (>= version 9.0r28). Place the mm.cfg file in your home directory to enable logging, and tail the log file 
in C:\Documents and Settings\USER_NAME\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player\Logs\.
