	<comment>Information about this pattern package (The Mead 5x8 Notebook). The values in this file are determined experimentally, by testing it with a streaming pen, and docking the pen to retrieve the batched coordinates. Also, we assume pattern spaces are wide strips. For example, in the BNet pattern, subsequent pages are laid out from left to right in the Anoto physical coordinate space. The BNet pattern is only one page tall, but 256 pages wide.</comment>
